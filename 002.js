/* 
Problem 2: Even Fibonacci NumbersPassed
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

  let sum = b;

  while (number >= b) {
    let c = a;

    b = c + b;
